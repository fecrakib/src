To add a remote repository named origin, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin <repository_URL>
Replace <repository_URL> with the URL of your remote repository. Once you've added the remote repository correctly, you should be able to push your changes to it using:

bash
Copy code
git push origin module
If you're unsure about the URL of your remote repository, you can check it using:

bash
Copy code
git remote -v
This command will show you the configured remote repositories along with their URLs. Once you have the correct URL, you can add it as origin and proceed with the push.
